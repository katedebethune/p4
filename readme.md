# Details for instructor / TA <br />
Site passed W3C validation testing, with warnings about the use of 
repeated H1 tags on the index page. I chose to disregard these warnings
about semantic markup since this really is a one-page site template. The
repeated use of H1 tags is intentional.

Despite some effort to implement custom error messages according to the Laravel
documentation, I was not able to show custom error messages in my views. The
default messages are being shown and some of these are not user friendly.
